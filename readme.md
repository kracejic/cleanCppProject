# cleanCppProject

This is a empty frame for project in C++. It should help to start a new project without caring much about project/build environment setup.

## How to convert this to your new project

~~~
git clone https://github.com/kracejic/cleanCppProject.git yourNewProject
cd yourNewProject
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
~~~

Do not forget to change name of *example* binary in `source/CMakeLists.txt` and `test/CMakeLists.txt`. 

## Building instructions

### Prerequisites

* CMake 3.2 and newer
* Compiler with support for C++14
* git - for downloading external resources
* Doxygen for docs (*Graphviz for more graphs in docs, PlantUML for more UML diagrams*, PlantUML needs java)
* clang-tools for static analysis and formating
* cppcheck for another static analysis

#### Prerequisites on Linux

* Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S cmake g++ graphviz git clang clang-tools-extra cppcheck java-runtime-common`
    * download plantuml.jar and have it somewhere where *PATH* points to

* Ubuntu 16.04: `sudo apt-get install cmake g++ graphviz plantuml git clang clang-tidy clang-format`

#### Prerequisites on Windows

Two ways, which were tested:

* msys2 based
    * Minimal: `pacman -S cmake g++ git`
    * Additional software `pacman -S clang mingw-w64-x86_64-clang-tools-extra mingw-w64-x86_64-clang-analyzer doxygen`
    * For graphs in documentation install Graphviz (to `c:\Program Files\Graphviz`, so scripts can find it) and add its `bin` subdirectory to *PATH*, install java (have it on *PATH*), download PlantUML jar file and have it on *PATH*. 

* Microsoft Visual Studio
    * Install cmake
    * Install git
    * For additional features install clang with tools, doxygen, graphviz, plantuml, java and add them to the PATH (*not tested*)

#### Prerequisites on macOS

* macOS Sierra `brew install llvm doxygen cppcheck graphviz`

### Build on Linux & macOS

Standard Makefiles:
~~~
mkdir build ; cd build
cmake ..
make -j8
~~~


Ninja build witch clang, build all+doc and install it to dist folder:
~~~
mkdir build ; cd build
cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER="clang++" ..
ninja all doc && ninja install
~~~


### Build on windows

#### Build on windows using MSYS2 + ninja

On windows you should prefer Ninja since it is much faster than make (but has no color in shell).

With gcc:
~~~
mkdir build ; cd build
cmake -GNinja ..
ninja install
~~~


#### Build on Windows using Microsoft Visual Studio 14

First you may wan to change project name in main `CMakeLists.txt`. Just go to the folder with the project and create new directory and create project files with this:

~~~
mkdir buildmsvc
cd buildmsvc
cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015" ..
~~~

and you can now open a `.sln` file with Visual Studio. You need to right click on executable target and *Set as StartUp project*. To really see the console window you want to do *Start without debugging*, since when run in debug mode only, console widow is closed too fast.

### Targets

*Note:* Availability of some targets depends on availability certain executables (e.g. clang-format for *format* target)

* Build
    * *all* (the default if no target is provided)
    * *clean*
    * *install* - install binaries into *CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX*
    * *example* - build example binary
    * *example-run* - build, install and run example binary (for your convenience)
    * *run* - alias for example-run (in order to keep it short)
* Testing
    * *check* - run whole test suite (see test/CMakeLists.txt)
    * *checkVerbose* - run whole test suite (see test/CMakeLists.txt), but more verbose
    * *unit* - build and run unit tests only (see test/CMakeLists.txt)
    * *unitall* - same as previous, only prints even successful unit tests results
* Miscellaneous
    * *doc* - build documentation (if doxygen is available)
    * *format* - run clang-format on all source files (.clang-format in root directory of a project is used)
* Static analysis
    * *tidy* - run clang static analysis on all sources
    * *cppcheck* - call cppcheck on all files (another static analysis)
* External
    * *external-update-all* - update all external sources/projects
    * *external-update-Catch* - update Catch (Unit test library)


### CMAKE variables

* `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`= - location for installation
* `-DVERSION_HOST`= - build machine name, see Version::getVersionLong
* `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`=RelWithDebInfo - for build type
